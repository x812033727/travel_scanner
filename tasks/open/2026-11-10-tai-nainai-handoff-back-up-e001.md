## Notes

## Context
The session that made 《恁祖媽今年18》 episodes 1–5 ended on 2026-11-10. Read
`docs/videos/series-plans/top40-2025-2026/2025-01-tai-nainai/production/session-tools/README.md` first.

- Episodes 1–5 are imported and wait for the owner at /admin/videos.
- Their production files were never copied to Google Drive (the old session could not read the rclone variables).
  Their latest copies are on the retired backup branches in `drama-backup-tn`; the host is moving those branches to Drive.
  Branches `transfer/tn-e001`, `tn-e004`, `tn-e005`, `tn-shared` match the final local files (independently checked).
  `transfer/tn-e002` and `transfer/tn-e003` were brought up to date in one last push the owner allowed (2026-11-10 07:11 UTC;
  e002 5884 files, e003 4301 files) and independently checked: 0 missing, 0 mismatched. Every branch of this series is now the final
  state of the old session's files; the episode 2/3 polish takes in `_scratchpad/fix4/` are on `tn-shared` (checked 04:46 UTC).
- Episode 6 is storyboarded and reviewed (37 shots) and nothing has been spent; the prepared manifests are in `session-tools/e006/`.
- Cap from episode 6: 40 CU (owner 2026-11-10).

- [ ] confirm the host migration put `transfer/tn-e00N` and `tn-shared` under `AI劇/恁祖媽今年18/` on Drive
- [ ] episode 6: pictures → stills → clips → pick → fix → refine → cut → review → import → todrive.sh
